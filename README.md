# KDAGTask - Neural Network and Logistic Regression Implementation

Welcome to the KDAGTask repository! Here, you will find the code and resources for implementing Neural Network and Logistic Regression algorithms from scratch, as well as using the popular SCI-KIT library. Get ready to explore the exciting world of machine learning and deep learning!

## Getting Started

To get started with the KDAGTask code, follow these steps:

1. **Download the Code**: You can download the code by clicking on the "Download ZIP" button located at the top of this repository.

2. **Unzip the File**: If you downloaded the ZIP file, extract its contents to a location of your choice.

3. **Prerequisites**: Before running the code, ensure you have the following installed on your system:

   - Python (>=3.6)
   - NumPy
   - SciPy
   - Pandas
   - Matplotlib
   - Sci-Kit Learn (optional, for comparing implementations)

   You can install these packages using `pip`:

   ```
   pip install numpy scipy pandas matplotlib scikit-learn
   ```

4. **Run the Code**: Now comes the exciting part! Navigate to the code directory and explore the following files:

   - `neural_network.py`: This file contains the implementation of a simple neural network from scratch. You can modify the network architecture, train it on your dataset, and experiment with various hyperparameters.

   - `logistic_regression.py`: Here, you'll find the implementation of logistic regression from scratch. It's a fundamental binary classification algorithm that you can use as a starting point for your projects.

   - `scikit_neural_network.py`: If you want to compare your custom neural network with a more powerful implementation, this file demonstrates how to use the Sci-Kit Learn library for neural networks.
